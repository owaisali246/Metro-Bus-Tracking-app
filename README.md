# Metro Bus Tracking Website

The Purpose of this project is to create a Tracking system which will provide its users with real-time tracking of the Green Line Metro Bus, which is recently launched in Karachi, and along with it also provide different features like calculating the fares of the metro bus from one station to the other and showing the estimated time and distance to reach a stop.
